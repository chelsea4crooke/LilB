        <br></br>
          <div className="aboutText">
              <p>Andrew Westbrook moved into Lucy Lane in 2010. Back then it was not as such but he was heavily involved in the Richmond music scene and wanted to curate the space back in the woods as somewhat of a commune. A place where people could come be themselves, be safe, have meals together, and have a place to share common interest and ideas. </p>
              <p>This unfortunately never took off as a formal concept but the thought and the idea were there. Fast forward a couple of years. Andrew was out one night and met one of his former co workers who he knew at one time was making music. Being in the market for a new band himself asked if he was still writing. Soon after a new band formed called Lucy in Battle Armor and they began to practice in the house.</p>
              <p>After a couple years of writing music and playing in the basement. The band started to hit the Richmond music scene. Making friends with a few bands around town it was seen on social media one day that a local band we had gigged with had a show pulled from underneath them due to a double booking at a venue in town. In the spirit of helping and community Lucy in Battle Armor decided to open up their practice space and their home and host the show to help out.</p>
              <p>One of the bands on the bill was on tour and was enamored  with our willingness to help out on such short notice. In their travels with another band they mentioned the space to the band that was touring with them  and they reached out to us. </p>
              <p>With no actual intent on starting or running a house venue we saw the joy and pleasure we could bring and throughout the years and word of mouth Lucy Lane has grown and become the place we all hold so dearly in our hearts today. Currently Andrew Westbrook, Andrew Smith, and Miranda Jaroneski live at Lucy Lane. We’d love for you to stop by and see us sometime.</p>

            <li className="list-group-item FAQ">So what is a DIY venue exactly?</li>
              <p className="answer">A DIY venue is a place for all artists to come and share their craft in a non-traditional way. We do not make profit from any donations. We focus on making our home a place where everyone feels welcome and safe, a sanctuary to hang out with old and new friends alike while experiencing live music.</p>
            <li className="list-group-item FAQ">
              How do you go about booking shows?
            </li>
              <p className="answer" >The process is usually pretty straight forward. A band on tour will give us dates they’d like to play and if were available we find local acts that fit the sound and we’ve got ourselves a show. We do not typically book weeknights and to maintain balance we do not book every weekend every month.</p>
            <li className="list-group-item FAQ">
                  What’s the address?
            </li>
                <p className="answer">We do not give out the address publicly. It is our home after all. If you’d like to come to a show, fill out this form and we’ll send you a password. You’ll be able to access the address and all directions 8:00am the day of the show. You will not be able to access it after the show is over and the password changes every show.</p>
