# ***Lucy Lane***
 
Lucy Lane is a performing arts venue run out of one our group members basement. This "DIY" venue has previously operated only on social media, primarily Facebook and Instagram. This app was created to bridge the gap between social media users and non.
 
## ***Overview***
 
The Lucy Lane website includes the following:
 
1. Home/ landing page to provide an overall theme for the site.
2. About page for the guests to read about the history of the venue as well as some frequently asked questions.
3. An Upcoming Shows page, for the obvious reasons.
4. The artists page uses MongoDB to display all artists that have previously played at Lucy Lane or are scheduled to play.
5. Press, this is a recent addition as Lucy Lane has had some recent recognition in local press.
6. The Directions tab is two fold, one page describes that the address will not be available publicly at all times. There is a button that requires a password to access. This password has a time frame attached to it using Unix Timestamp. Admin users of Lucy Lane edit this timestamp according to showtimes. Javascript, jQuery and Unix Timestamp were used together to great this hidden address page.
7. Contact Us is also a page with multiple features. A place for nonsocial media users to get in contact with the managers of Lucy Lane. It also provides a place for artists to contact these same managers about booking a show at the venue. There are links in the Jumbotron on this page link to the different contact forms. MongoDB stores the text input by the users for the managers to access at any time.
8. The professional photographer that attends select shows is linked in the footer as well as Lucy Lane's Facebook and Instagram.
9. Heroku is used to deploy this app.
